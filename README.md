Introduction

This repository contains a collection of PySpark scenario-based questions, complete with solutions and explanations. These scenarios cover a range of topics, from data manipulation and transformations to performance optimization and debugging. Whether you are preparing for interviews, seeking to improve your PySpark skills, or just interested in learning more about real-world applications of PySpark, this repository is for you!

Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyspark-scenario-based-questions.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd pyspark-scenario-based-questions
Install the required dependencies. Make sure you have PySpark installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyspark
Practice Scenarios

The scenarios are organized in the scenarios directory. Each scenario includes:

Description: A brief overview of the problem.
Solution: A detailed solution implemented in PySpark.
Explanation: An explanation of the approach taken and key concepts used.
To practice, open the .py files in the scenarios directory and try to solve the problems yourself before checking the provided solutions.

Example Scenario
Description: Given a dataset of user transactions, write a PySpark script to calculate the total amount spent by each user and sort the results in descending order.

Solution: (Refer to the file scenarios/total_amount_spent.py)

Explanation: This scenario demonstrates the use of DataFrame transformations and aggregations to solve a common data processing task.
